# Reactivities
A social platform application that is being continually added to in conjunction with the Udemy course listed below. My end goal is to learn how to create a full application that incorporates data management and API's using dotnet and displays a UI built with React.js from start to finish. 

## Install Packages

Run the command within the project directory to install packages from the project dependencies

```
$ cd ../Reactivities
$ npm install
```

## Project Setup and Execution

### Start the back-end implementation

```
$ cd ../Reactivities/API
$ dotnet run
```

### Start the front-end implementation

In the 'client-app' project directory, you can run the React app:

```
$ cd Reactivities\client-app
$ npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
